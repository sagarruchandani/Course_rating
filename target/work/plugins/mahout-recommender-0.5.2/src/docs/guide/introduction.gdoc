The Mahout Recommender plugin enabled you to use "Apache Mahout":http://mahout.apache.org/ recommendation 
algorithms in your Grails project. With the plugin, you can find an effective recommender, 
evaluating precision and recall, and evaluating the performance of the 
selected recommender without writing single line of code. 

Then, the selected recommender can be enabled by configuration and used by your application instantly. 

You only need to write custom recommender when out-of-the-box recommenders doesn't meet 
your application-specific requirements.
