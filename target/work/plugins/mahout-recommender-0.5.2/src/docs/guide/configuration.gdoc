The plugin support both the file data model and MySQL data model.

For file data model, no additional configuration is required to make use of 
command line tool of the plugin, but the data file must be located in classpath such as @grails-app/conf@ 
and data file name must be specified in @mahout.recommender.data.file@ for web-based tools such as 
[recommenders' evaluator|guide:evaluator] and [recommender|guide:webRecommender].

For MySQL data model, change @mahout.recommender.data.model@ from @'file'@ to @'mysql'@ 
and configure the @DataSource.groovy@ properly.
